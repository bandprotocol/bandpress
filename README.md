# Band Protocol Overview

## What is Band Protocol?

[Band Protocol](https://bandprotocol.com) is an all-in-one platform for building and managing decentralized token-curated communities. The protocol allows developers to build decentralized communities with their own unique crypto tokens, and utilize prebuilt cryptoeconomic modules in the communities. Community tokens are algorithmically backed using continuous bonding curve to guarantee their values. Band Protocol is currently live on [Rinkeby](https://rinkeby.io) testnet, so you can start BUIDLing applications on it right now!

## Why should you consider building with Band?

Building decentralized applications all by yourself is both hard and dangerous. Once smart contracts are deployed, they are out there _immutably_ and _permanently_. Band Protocol allows you to leverage existing bulletproof smart contracts with well-researched crypto mechanics that work. Additionally, Band Protocol provides you with external tooling to help you get up to speed, including JavaScript library and a web portal for users to interact with your community tokens, and gives your tokens instance liquidity via Band token. It takes less than 5 minutes to get a community up and running decentrally. Let's BUIDL
