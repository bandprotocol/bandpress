# Band Protocol Overview

[Band Protocol](https://bandprotocol.com) is a protocol for decentralized data curation on the Ethereum blockchain. Using various token economics, the protocol incentivizes multiple independent parties to work cooperatively to provide trusted data. Curated information is available on-chain, ready to be consumed by other blockchain protocols or decentralized applications. **Band Protocol serves as the data layer of the Web3 ecosystem, bridging real world and/or subjective information to the smart contract world.**

## Open Data Layer for √êApps

Band Protocol is currently [live](https://data.bandprotocol.com) on Rinkeby testnet, so you can start experimenting with it right now. As of current, the protocol officially supports three public data endpoints:

1. **Price Feed Endpoint** [0xTODO...](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io) for hourly exchange rates of BTC/USD, ETH/USD, and LTC/USD.
2. **Sports Endpoint** [0xTODO...](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io) for sport results 4 major leagues: [NFL](https://www.nfl.com), [NBA](https://www.nba.com/), [MLB](https://www.mlb.com/), and [EPL](https://www.premierleague.com/).
3. **Lotteries Endpoint** [0xTODO...](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io) for up-to-date US [Powerball](www.powerball.com) and [MegaMillions](www.megamillions.com/) winning numbers.

See [Data Query](/docs/data-query.html) section for technical explanation of how to utilize these data endpoints.

## Earn from Curating Datapoints

Each datapoint in Band Protocol is governed by its own dedicated community. Anyone can join and help secure the community by purchasing and staking the community's token. Stakers collectively curate  data and ensure its trustworthiness. In return, they earn proportional portions of fees collected from data consumption. See [Delegated Curation](/docs/delegated-curation.html) and [Token Curated Registry](/docs/tcr.html) for more details.
